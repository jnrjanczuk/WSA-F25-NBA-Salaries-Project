# WSA-F25-NBA-Salaries-Project
This is the bulk of the code I used to visualize data for my NBA Salaries project for Wolverine Sports Analytics' Fall '25 Project Expo. Everything was done in Python in Google Colab using libraries allowing me to scrape and clean data, conduct statisical analysis, and then visualize the results. The purpose of this project was to highlight the "true" value of NBA players, that is to say, how much money they deserve to be paid based on their performance versus how much they are paid in reality.
